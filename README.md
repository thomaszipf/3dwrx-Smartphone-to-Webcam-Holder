##Why this design?

Since the Corona Virus forced most of us (where possible) to a more home-centric work environment, the demand of Webcams for online meetings has been rising. Also, business cultural changes have been going on and encouraging people to activate Webcams as possible. Personally, I stuck between two sub optimal conditions. I have an Webcam on my Notebook but … since I’m used to use several screens, I figured out that I more often then not do not even near the webcam. Other then that, the in-build webcam was not any kind of a criteria while making a choice for the notebook. So I while asking myself if an mobile cam wouldn’t be good enough, it turned out that this cam actually is maybe far better then any web cam I can buy for the cheap. Following Linus Tech Tips Youtube channel, I exactly found the referencing article and – now I just needed a mount for my screen to mount the phone securely. – Here it is, holding my Galaxy S10.

However, there are quite some limitations, since I especially fitted the model to match the Samsung Galaxy S10 as well as the Asus PB287Q Monitor. So I assume the Design will be generic enough to fit some other Monitors, but probably not generic enough to fit most Monitors. Please check this upfront before printing.

What are the core features?
• Put the holder on top of your screen
• Put any type of phone up to 80mm in height
• Adjust viewing angle by screw from the back
• Looks nice
• Optimized to print

If you image to look at it from the front, just turn it by 90° to the left and make sure there are supports within the frame. I Printed it otherwise without support on a Prusa MK3S at 15% Infill and PLA.
